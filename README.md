[Parlay Proz](https://parlayproz.com/) transforms real-time sports data into powerful insights for NBA, NHL, WNBA, and MLB. We build lightweight APIs and dashboards to help analysts, fans, and developers explore player trends and performance metrics. Focused on clean data, predictive tools, and community collaboration — shaping the future of sports intelligence.
In today’s data-driven world, making smart betting decisions isn’t just about luck—it’s about access to accurate insights, real-time analytics, and a user-focused platform. At Parlay Proz, we don’t just deliver stats—we provide a complete ecosystem that helps sports bettors think strategically, react quickly, and win more consistently.
Whether you're into NBA props, NHL trends, WNBA matchups, or MLB performances, our platform gives you the tools to turn raw data into confident wagers. Let’s dive into how Parlay Proz transforms the way you bet—and how tech plays a critical role behind the scenes.
The Power of Real-Time Sports Scanning
Parlay Proz uses a real-time scanner that aggregates player and team statistics across major sports like:
NBA


WNBA


MLB


NHL


The scanner is engineered to capture critical data such as Points, Assists, Rebounds, Field Goal Attempts, Pitcher Strikeouts, Goals, and more—allowing users to filter, compare, and analyze information that directly influences betting outcomes.
# Real-Time Data Flow
Behind the scenes, our system uses a robust API integration that pulls sports data from trusted sources and delivers it to our frontend dashboard in seconds.
const axios = require('axios');
require('dotenv').config();

const getLiveStats = async (sport) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${process.env.API_BASE_URL}/${sport}/live`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
      }
    });
    console.log(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching ${sport} data:`, error.message);
  }
};

getLiveStats('nba');

Stake Lines + Hit Rate: What Makes Our Data Unique?
One standout feature on Parlay Proz is our ability to show Stake Lines alongside Hit Rates across 5, 10, 15, and 20 game intervals.
For example, if you're betting on an NBA player’s Points + Assists + Rebounds (PAR), our scanner lets you quickly see:
What the line is (e.g. 31.5)


# How often the player has hit that line over the past games


Matchup context (e.g. performance against similar teams)


This kind of insight helps users identify value bets and avoid the trap of betting based on emotion or recent highlights alone.
function calculateHitRate(stats, line) {
  const hits = stats.filter(game => game.total >= line);
  return ((hits.length / stats.length) * 100).toFixed(2);
}

const playerStats = [29, 34, 31, 36, 28];
const line = 30;
const hitRate = calculateHitRate(playerStats.map(p => ({ total: p })), line);
console.log(`Hit Rate: ${hitRate}%`);

Predictive Analytics for Confident Decision-Making
We’re not just a stats platform—we’re a predictive tool. Our [algorithmic models](https://parlayproz.com/) help users find parlay trends, identify sharp line movements, and highlight profitable prop bets before the odds shift.
Parlay Trends in Action
By aggregating large volumes of user behavior and performance data, Parlay Proz can spot:
Which parlay combinations are trending


# How often specific combos hit or miss


Shifts in public vs. sharp money bets


const parlayTrends = (bets) => {
  const trends = {};
  bets.forEach(({ combo }) => {
    trends[combo] = trends[combo] ? trends[combo] + 1 : 1;
  });
  return Object.entries(trends).sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
};

const bets = [
  { combo: 'PlayerA+PlayerB' },
  { combo: 'PlayerA+PlayerB' },
  { combo: 'PlayerC+PlayerD' }
];

console.log(parlayTrends(bets));

# Monitoring Line Movements for Market Advantage
Parlay Proz allows users to track:
Opening odds


Current lines


Time-based movement


Injury alerts tied to line changes


const fetchLineMovements = async () => {
  try {
    const res = await axios.get(`${process.env.API_BASE_URL}/nba/lines`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`
      }
    });
    const movements = res.data.map(line => ({
      team: line.team,
      open: line.opening_odds,
      current: line.current_odds
    }));
    console.table(movements);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Line movement error:', err);
  }
};

fetchLineMovements();

Accuracy, Reliability & Clean Design
We focus on what matters most:
Easy-to-read player cards


Clean mobile responsiveness


Intuitive filtering


Fast performance under load


const PlayerCard = ({ player }) => (
  <div className="player-card">
    <h4>{player.name}</h4>
    <p>Team: {player.team}</p>
    <p>Points: {player.points}</p>
    <p>Assists: {player.assists}</p>
    <p>Rebounds: {player.rebounds}</p>
  </div>
);
